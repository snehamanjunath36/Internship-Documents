<h1 align="center"> FACIAL EMOTION DETECTION USING NEURAL NETWORKS </h1>
<li> Facial emotion detection using neural networks is a project that aims to analyze and recognize human emotions from facial expressions. </li>
<li> Neural networks, specifically deep learning models, are employed to train a system to automatically detect emotions from facial images or video frames.</li>
<li> The project involves collecting a labeled dataset of facial expressions, which includes images of individuals displaying different emotions.</li>
<li> The dataset is then used to train a deep neural network, typically a convolutional neural network (CNN), to learn patterns and features associated with each emotion.</li>
<li> The CNN model undergoes a training process where it adjusts its internal weights and biases to minimize the difference between predicted emotions and the ground truth labels in the training dataset.</li>
<li> Once the model is trained, it can be deployed to detect emotions in real-time or on new unseen images or video frames.</li>
<li> During the detection phase, the trained model processes facial images or frames, extracts relevant features, and classifies them into different emotion categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.
